# Project: Infinite Scroll and Submitting a Form with AJAX

An infinite-scrolling page of movies with Ajax from the [Open Movie Database(OMDB)](http://www.omdbapi.com/) for The Odin Project's [Project: Infinite Scroll and Submitting a Form with AJAX.](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript-and-jquery/lessons/infinite-scroll-and-submitting-a-form-with-ajax)

1. It makes an AJAX call to the database to retrieve and display 10 movies on your page.
2. It loads another 10 movies and adds them to the bottom every time you scroll down to the bottom of the page.

Update: the [Open Movie Database(OMDB)](http://www.omdbapi.com/) is not free anymore, so the ajax call will not 
search result back get without an api key.
